# TweetsFetchandUploadintoMySQL

The above code connects between React.js and Node.js. 
Using twitter developer account I am fetching all the tweets based on keyword entered by user(in React.js)
Later storing these tweets into Mysql database and fetching them into React.js and displaying the tweets.
